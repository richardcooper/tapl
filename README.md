# Types and Programming Languages

Various bits of code related to the book ["Types and Programming
Languages"](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/) by Benjamin C. Pierce,
which we are reading at the [London Computation
Club](http://london.computation.club).

Much more information on the [club
wiki](https://github.com/computationclub/computationclub.github.io/wiki).

The Jupyter notebooks in this repo are best viewed locally or on
[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/richardcooper/tapl/tree/master/).
Github will display the notebooks but it [blocks custom
CSS](http://blog.jupyter.org/2015/05/07/rendering-notebooks-on-github/) which
makes the derivation trees render badly.
